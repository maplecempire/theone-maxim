            <h2>The future is Algo-trading : Conceptual Background & Research Journey</h2>
            <h5>TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION</h5>
            <p align="justify">Majority of the people are unaware of the on going Automated Trading revolution. Yet, they are well familiar with other revolutions that have radically changed the world within the past decade: The Internet, Online Trading, Email, Blogs, Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Skype and the list goes on.</p>
            <p align="justify">The advent of these technological advances have completely changed how we lead our lives. Could you imagine going about your daily activities without having access to your email, having to do research without search engines or having to execute every trade manually over the phone?</p>
            <p align="justify">Yet the investing industry has changed little outside of the use of online brokers. Since the Internet is a powerful empowering technology, tools and information that help people analyze what to buy or sell is widely available and highly accessible. Besides this, everything else pretty much remains the same. Technology has not been utilised to its full potential when it comes to the aspect of trading.</p>
            <p align="justify">The Automated Trading revolution will change all that. As people become more informed about the benefits of Automated Trading, they will begin utilizing these systems to gradually replace old investment strategies. Automated Trading enables higher returns with lesser risks. And, it puts them in control of their money.</p>
            <p align="justify">The most important benefit of Automated Trading systems is the value it creates for users. The use of technical analysis to trade using a defined system creates consistency, negates human emotion, and recognises opportunity for superior returns.</p>

            <h5>IMPACT OF HIGH SPEED INTERNET</h5>
            <p align="justify">It is arguable that the realisation of Automated Trading is driven largely by Artificial Intelligence advancements of the last decade. And that’s probably true. Besides this powerful force, there is another trend that has supported Automated Trading in a big way: the dawn of high speed Internet.</p>
            <p align="justify">Why is the internet integral to Automated Trading? It allows the masses to benefit from it, practically anyone with access to a computer and an internet connection. Currently Automated Trading systems are being used mainly by hedge fund managers and these systems are capable of producing outstanding returns. However, the underlying issue is that most hedge funds are restricted to accredited investors. In other words, the average investor are excluded from participation.</p>
            <p align="justify">High speed internet overcomes this problem because it allows Automated Trading systems to connect directly to an individual’s trading account. Even if they only have a few thousand dollars in their account, they can still reap the benefits of advanced artificial intelligence Automated Trading systems since there is no minimum net worth or income requirements to open a regular trading account.</p>
            <p align="justify">Automated Trading systems and the internet will change the financial future of individuals throughout the world. These systems will revolutionize and redefine the foundations of the investment industry and Maxim Trader is at the forefront of this phenomenon.</p>

            <h5>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO YOU, THE INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS?</h5>
            <p align="justify">It means that the shift to using Automated Trading can happen faster than ever before. It is easy for people to be better informed about how it works and why these systems can help in their goal towards achieving financial freedom. And, perhaps most compelling, as computers become ever faster and technology improves, the returns from these systems will further enhance. That translates to higher returns and lower risks.</p>
            <p align="justify">One criticism of Automated Trading is that once too many people use it, it will cease to work. Contrary to such a speculation, the opposite is true. In actual fact, as more Automated Trading systems are used and more assets are traded, it is more likely to detect trends and of course, make money. Presently, majority of trading decisions are still made by human traders. As Automated Trading systems grow, more executions of decisions will be determined by computers instead. These systems are much simpler and have much less variation in their decisions therefore making it even easier to identify market trends and patterns.</p>
            <p align="justify">Another result of such automated systems is an increase in volatility. Most Automated Trading systems detect and ride trends. As more computers ride the same trends faster, the compounding effect will cause the movement to become bigger. Bigger trends then attract more Automated Trading systems and people, and a virtuous circle is created. Automated Trading systems will perform better as these trends become bigger and easier to identify and take advantage of.</p>
            <p align="justify">So, it is evident that Automated Trading will revolutionize how people trade the markets. A big change like this is not happening for the first time. The internet itself changed the way that people interact. It has made it possible for anyone regardless of capital to trade in the FOREX market. This gave rise to the retail trading market which is one of the most profitable businesses in the world </p>

            <h5>THE FOREX MARKET</h5>
            <p align="justify">More than $1.9 trillion U.S dollar is traded daily in the Forex market and it is with no doubt the largest financial market in the world. It is composed of approximately 4,500 international world banks and retail brokers and exponential growth has been recorded over the past few years.</p>
            <p align="justify">People buy and sell different currencies, in an attempt to make money as the relative values fluctuate. Forex is popular as it allows traders very fast executions, has tight spreads and provides high leverage. Yet human traders are not the only ones who can benefit from these advantages.</p>
            <p align="justify">With the Automated Trading Systems, a given currency pair can be traded and its relative prices monitored in real time. The systems can make a buying or selling decision in a fraction of a second, and send executions for orders with ruthless efficiency and accuracy. Considering the immensely liquid and highly volatile nature of the currency market, an Automated Trading System is an apt solution.</p>
            <p align="justify">Automated Trading is not a silver bullet for investing, and there are still risks associated with it. However, it will continue to improve with technology and help millions of people achieve financial independence. We recognise the fact that Automated Trading Systems that trade the currencies market will play a huge role in this revolution.</p>

            <h5>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h5>
            <p align="justify">We are excited about the prospects of Automated Trading Systems. These computer programs automatically buy and sell currencies , stocks, options and other liquid assets, akin to a human trader. The big improvement however, is that positive returns are consistently generate with the absence of emotional reactions present in human traders.</p>
            <p align="justify">Many different strategies are being explored for these Automated Trading Systems . Usually, a trading program would be encoded, but we at Hexagon wanted to take it up a notch. What if we could develop Artificial Intelligence that could generate its own trading systems? Would it be possible to create systems that work better than those designed by humans?</p>
            <p align="justify">Our answer here is yes. Artificial Intelligence empowers the computer to generate its own trading strategies. These strategies have the potential to provide better returns with less risk as compared to human traders. Many people have doubts in such a possibility.</p>
            <p align="justify">The age old problem for human traders lies in the natural possession of emotions. As humans, virtually every trader is at the mercy of their emotions regardless of how much they try, or think they can suppress it . When you win, you are elated. When you lose, you are dejected. Many people enjoy this thrill. This common ailment is known as gambling. People do it at the casino, and they do it when they trade. It requires a very special mindset to totally eradicate emotions during trading. Seldom does any trader manage to master this skill. Even if they do, it could be at the hands of very highly priced mistake or what we call, learning process.</p>
            <p align="justify">The reason behind the reduced risk is because Artificial Intelligence generated automated trading systems can measure risk better than any human ever could. Computers are, literally, great at computational work, and that includes statistical analysis commonly used to measure trading strategies. We have found it possible for an integrated risk management system that leverages off the computer’s number crunching ability to develop an automated trading system that deals less risk.</p>
            <p align="justify">Another major advantage to using an Artificial Intelligence approach to developing automated trading systems is that computers are getting faster all the time. What is brand new today is probably replaced 6 months down the road. As computing power continue to improve, so do the results of Artificial Intelligence systems. That means given all things constant and we do absolutely nothing, the results of an Artificial Intelligence system will improve purely based on hardware advancement.</p>
            <p align="justify">There is already a paradigm shift on a global scale as Hedge funds and global trading banks are developing proprietary systems that are singularly responsible for the massive jump in trading volume across all asset classes.</p>
            <p align="justify">Hexagon has undertaken a similar action in this massive revolution for automated trading systems at the retail level so that all our clients can gain this ‘unfair advantage’ when we pit man versus machine.</p>

Each element of an algorithmic trading strategy can be analysed separately and in combination over market and trading history. Our expertise has allowed <b>MaximTrade Executor™</b>  to develop ground-breaking transaction cost analysis techniques.</p>

            <h5>MAXIMTRADE STRATEGIES</h5>
            <p align="justify"><b>MaximTrade Executor™</b> is not designed to be directional, but instead working the bid/offer spread to its maximum advantage while nevertheless moving price up or down like a game of Chutes and Ladders. The Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is one of the more simplistic tools to follow that taps into some of the order-flow peculiarities of the algo-trading phenomenon.</p>
            <p align="justify">A very brief glimpse into our formulation, the VWAP, is calculated by dividing the sum of the dollars traded (price multiplied by share volume) for every transaction by the total shares traded for the day.</p>
            "Calculation Image"
            <br>Where:
            <br>Pj = the price of trade j
            <br>Qj = the quantity of trade j
            <br>j = each trade taking place over the time period
            <br><br>"IMAGE"
            <br>The center green line is the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) with one and two standard deviations (STD) marked. The blue and red arrows are suggested entry points, buying and selling to take advantage of the price discovery. The 100-period simple moving average (pink line) can be used to aid with trend direction.</p>
            <br>When the price bar closes through the VWAP, then a move to the second STD should be anticipated. Using the VWAP as a median line similar in nature to a pivot, that once penetrated and confirmed by a close, indicates that further advancement is likely. On subsequent bars, if there is no further advance, then a pullback to the first STD can be expected — again, using the close as a confirmation with a stop and reverse strategy either on a failure below the VWAP or at the top/bottom of the range and the second STD.</p>

            <h5>MAXIMTRADE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES</h5>
            <p align="justify"><b>Optimised trading - Long term approach with short term gains</b> Traders tend to fall largely into the category known as momentum strategists. The characteristics of these traders are they tend to look for breakouts, buying high in the hopes of selling even higher. More often that not, they get trapped by the whipsaw of the algorithm and end upside-down on their positions. Conversely, this does not happen in algo-trading performed by the <b>MaximTrade Executor™</b></p>
            <p align="justify"><b>MaximTrade Executor™</b> programmed to detect long-term trader behavior and establish the degree of power of the buying pressure. The time horizon of such a strategy looks at the market in a holistic way and targets the opportunity for a larger advance. The primary concern is whether the long-term trader will be aggressive and buy as price rises or be passive and try to buy low and create a basing action? This is when child orders come into play. By monitoring child orders, <b>MaximTrade Executor™</b> can sniff out long-term trading action and effectively front-run orders, believing that if there was a buyer at x, then they will pay x-plus to fill additional positions.</p>
            <br><b>The Unfair Advantage</b>
            <p align="justify">Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) has always been in the domain of the institutional trader. Essentially it is akin to a dollar-averaging process. Institutions may wish to achieve a particular percentage or market share where time becomes an added factor for consideration rather than purely volume. For example, they may buy a line of stock whereby they remain constant at, say, 10% of the volume transacted. An alternative would be to transact a certain quantity split into x units every minute over a 15-minute time period.</p>
            <p align="justify">This creates the impression that they will not upset the natural order flow and balance of the market. The reality is that an institution, despite being price conscious, needs to reflect the average of all their buys vs. sells rather than the actual price. This is complicated additionally in that the objective of some funds is to invest and monitor performance on a relative basis. This might be performance measured against their peers or some benchmark, whereas other funds are more about actual performance.</p>
            <p align="justify">Unlike these large players, retail traders are not blessed with inordinate amounts of money and simply seek fair value calculation identified by volume. However, pure volume probably is irrelevant, as it is the pattern created that becomes key. After all, how many times have traders intoned how volume is weak yet price continues to grind higher? <b>MaximTrade Executor™</b> can correct this by providing a relative view of the markets, and traders thereby can align themselves with our high-frequency algorithmic trading rather than fight the machines.</p>
