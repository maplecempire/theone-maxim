Dear Jason,

As you have received the 3 versions translated accordingly, please email them to individual members whose accounts will mature in May and June 2014.

Please note the version for May does not contain any specific expiry dates, we just mention expiry in May only. But for those expiring in June, please mention the exact expiry dates.

There is a third version which you need to send to "incentive account" holders only. Please close their account and zerorize the day following the maturity day. 

Please try to send to all the May expiries today, if possible.

Thank you,
Revi
