            <p align="justify"><strong>Maxim Partner is an affiliate of Maxim Trader</strong>. This Consortium is the latest project undertaken by Maxim Trader to develop a cooperative for financial leverage with a pioneering inclusion of third party individuals.</p>
            <p align="justify">Our business model is simple and straight forward : to maximize leverage through a system of pooled resources coupled with trading technology and expertise.
            Our objective is clear : to profit in an exponential manner to benefit both company and clients.</p>


            <p align="justify">
                One of the most powerful tools successful people use on a regular basis is leverage.
                Leverage means utilizing the strengths of other people, processes and things, to
                do a lot more than what you would have otherwise done alone.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                The famous Greek mathematician, Archimedes, said: <I>“Give me a lever long enough and
                a place to stand, and I can move the world.”</I>
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                The financial market is an immensely rich environment for those well endorsed enough
                to take advantage of. While Professional traders and Portfolio managers do make
                an obscene amount of money, other traders just experience the tip of the iceberg
                of wealth. For most traders, making money consistently is a difficult task. There
                are times where your judgment will be wrong or your timing will be off, resulting
                in loss of money. This is why the average individual is not actively trading, causing
                many opportunities to slip by and profit potential lost. Being consistently successful
                at trading takes knowledge, expertise and capital. The winner-takes-all nature of
                trading the markets explains the income disparity within the industry. The difference
                between simply trying to be rich and becoming fabulously rich traders lies in expertise,
                technology and systems.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                <strong>What makes the difference </strong>
                <br>
                Extraordinary profits are made by spotting an “incorrect” price and trading on it.
                But this is easier said than done and not everyone can get rich using this method.
                There is only so much money to be made in any one arbitrage opportunity. The first
                person who acts usually gets the biggest piece of the pie.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                There’s another reason why superior expertise is key: the “moving first” advantage.
                Let’s say for example some news hits the market and that traders interpret this
                news at different speeds. One trader figures out what the news means in a second,
                while the other traders require five seconds. Still, there are some other traders
                that require an entire day or maybe even up to a month to figure things out. The
                early traders earn the extra money. They get into action early, at optimal prices,
                and reap most of the gains while the other, later, slower traders pile on.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                <strong>Where Maxim Trader steps in </strong>
                <br>
                Individual investors lack the skills, expertise and technology to consistently profit
                from his trading. Needless to say, a more effective way is to pool resources to
                consistently come out ahead in this ruthless pursuit for trading gains.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                This is why the considerable resources of Maxim Trader is combined with those of its
                clients/shareholders; enlarging the capital base of both to profit from the immerse
                opportunities the financial markets of the day has to offer – the currency market.
            </p>
